                - Matching soft skills
                - Matching hard skills
                - Relevant experiences for the position

                - Other relevant keywords

            Step 2: Assign a score from 1 to 100 for each category based on how well the resume matches the job offer. Provide the scores in the specified format without any modifications.

            Step 3: Provide the output in two parts:
            1. An analysis summary of how the candidate's profile aligns with the role description in the job offer. Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the applicant in relation to the specified job offer description.
            2. A JSON format detailing the identified matches and their scores in each category using the template below. Ensure that the JSON format is strictly followed to avoid parsing errors:
